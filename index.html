<p class="content">We are the Morshian Corporation. Our mission is to build a peaceful galaxy. To this end, we have created guns for every purpose, have made our own cryptocurrency, have lowered the costs of necessary ores, and have contributed to biodiversity centers throughout the galaxy. We are shaping the future of the galaxy.</p>

    <h3 class="question">Guns</h3>
    <p>Guns are our strongest industry. Last galactic quarter, we sold over half a trillion handheld guns alone. We sold 20 billion spaceship guns and 10 billion planetary ones. We’re shaping the weapons industry with innovations in organic weaponry and ammunition made of dark matter. Our guns are the future.</p>

    <h3>Moshcoin</h3>
    <p>We started the cryptocurrency Moshcoin. We believe in business without borders, trade throughout the galaxy. You don’t have to worry about slow transactions while governments convert their currency because Moshcoin is accepted <i>everywhere</i>. Moshcoin means direct payment between buyer and seller, so you don't pay taxes nor leave records.</p>

    <h3>Minerals</h3>
    <p>We use the most sophisticated automated mining technology to extract 100 billion dollars worth of minerals from a single planet annually. Our fully autonomous systems can drain a planet within a mere decade, with no human input. Our autonomous machines can refine minerals like diamonds, gold, nickel, and copper to full 100% concentration in minutes.</p>

    <img src="https://static.thenounproject.com/png/3092670-84.png" alt="Life">
    <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
    <p>We have the greatest respect for all life. We deliver 500 million cubic kilometers of water to life centers annually. We are promoting healthy planetary climates and reversing the endangerment of species. We fuel agriculture so all creatures have a chance to live. We do not discriminate on intelligence, galactic origin, nor dysanthropomorphity. </p>

    <h3>Time</h3>
    <p>Morshian is also part of the XFR, the galactic organization which standardizes galactic time. We supply our computing power to ensure that everyone has free access to reliable time no matter where they are in the galaxy.</p>

    <h3>Assasination</h3>
    <p>We are currently charging 0.5-10 Moshcoin depending on the target. We will not kill employees nor those on good terms with Morshian.</p>

<p class="content">Morshian has been improving the quality of life since 2022. Morshu, our only ever CEO, saw the things wrong with the world and knew that he could make a difference. Instead of becoming a politician and getting nothing done, he sought to make a corporation so powerful that he could fix the world with the wave of his hand. That is Morshian, providing beautiful lives to 3.4 billion people across 20 planets. We don’t have the bureaucracy of a government where it takes years for a law to be passed. Morshu’s word is final, and Morshu is always right.</p>
